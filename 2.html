		This wiki is to help the CSSWG record resolutions and open issues, to share them with public, and to encourage public involvement in the development of CSS and its test suites. Contributions to this wiki are governed by the same conditions as the W3C Mobile Web Wiki Contribution Policy. Note that editing is restricted to CSS Working Group members except in the Testing section (which is open to all).
